For interacting with _XBuilder Server_ you need to use the set of REST endpoints _XBuilder Server_ exposes to you.

## Openapi.json

For having access to our REST API documentation you need to have _XBuilder Server_ running and then download our `openapi.json` file through:

- [http://localhost:8080/openapi](http://localhost:8080/openapi)

> You need to change `http://localhost:8080` depending on where you started the server

Once you have the `openapi.json` you can view it through the tool of your preference; we can recommend [Apicur](https://www.apicur.io/) or [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) but it is up to you.
